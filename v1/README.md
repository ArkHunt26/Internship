## Lessons Learned

I gathered good experience managing multipleÂ files, learned how to incorporate three distinct board flavours with examples to a single webpage, and discovered some creative ways to include the board descriptions and documentations.


I had a great time, picked up a lot of knowledge, and am eager to learn more.


Thank you.
